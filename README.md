My name is Subhan and i'm currently learning computer programming at leeds beckett university in my first year. As apart of my first module i'm just learning the foundations for programming as i'm still fairly inexperienced but wanting to learn more. I also want to use my current opportunity to use and explore new tools, improve my skills and work on projects to help me grow.
